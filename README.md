# suitebotwebsite2021

This repository contains a web page with scores and recordings of the 2021 TDD Tournament programming competition (also called SuiteBot).
The website is available as a [GitHub Page](https://strix-cz.github.io/suitebotwebsite2021/). You can watch a recording of a game after the last
development iteration [here](https://strix-cz.github.io/suitebotwebsite2021/player/playlevel.html?level=6). (To run the recording click 'Start'.)

I have explained how the TDD Tournament worked in a [talk at jOpenSpace conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8v9joCtmFI) (in Czech only).
